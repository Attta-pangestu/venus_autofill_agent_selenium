I have an updated and optimized JSON API endpoint at http://localhost:5173/api/staging/data-grouped that I need to integrate into my automation system.

**Task Requirements:**

1. **API Integration Update:**
   - Review the API structure in `config/data_grouped_sampel.json` 
   - Read the API documentation in `config/api_dokumentasi.md`
   - Update the existing application `run_user_controlled_automation.py` to use this new optimized API endpoint instead of the current data source

2. **Add Cross-Check Validation Feature:**
   - After the WebDriver completes data input processing, implement a validation system that:
     - Communicates progress updates between the web interface and WebDriver
     - Opens a validation page showing cross-check results of data that was input into the mill system
     - Validates data by querying directly from the database

3. **Database Validation Logic:**
   - **Test Mode:** Query from `[db_ptrj_mill_test].[dbo].[PR_TASKREGLN]` table
   - **Real Mode:** Query from `[db_ptrj_mill].[dbo].[PR_TASKREGLN]` table (same table structure, different database)
   
   **Validation Process:**
   - Match records using `PTRJ_employee_Id` (employee ID from staging data)
   - Compare transaction dates with date adjustment logic:
     - **Test Mode:** Subtract 1 month from the input transaction date
     - **Real Mode:** Use the original transaction date without modification
   - For each employee and transaction date, compare:
     - **Overtime Hours:** Where `OT = 1`, compare `Hours` field with overtime data from staging
     - **Regular Hours:** Where `OT = 0`, compare `Hours` field with regular work hours from staging
   - Mark data transfer as "SUCCESS" when both overtime and regular hours match between staging data and database records
   - Perform this validation for every transaction date processed

4. **Expected Outcome:**
   - Updated automation script using the new API
   - Cross-check validation feature that verifies data integrity after processing
   - Support for both test and real modes with appropriate database connections and date handling
   - Web interface showing validation results with success/failure status for each employee record
